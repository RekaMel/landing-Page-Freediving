        Imagine holding your breath for three minutes. Now imagine doing it as
        you dive to depths of 60 meter or more. This is routine for freedivers,
        who push their mind and body to extremes as they hold their breath for
        minutes at a time while descending far below the surface. While this new
        sport on the market sounds like a death trap, many believe it creates a
        intimate and meditative moment.
